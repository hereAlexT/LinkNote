## Inspiration

Sparking draws inspiration from several projects and methodologies, including Zettelkasten, Flomo, Roam Research, and Logseq.
##About
As a fan of Flomo, I realized while using it that it wasn't optimized for STEM students; it lacks support for Markdown and LaTeX formulas. I also wanted to integrate features to fulfil my customized needs, including headings, a calendar, to-dos, and reminders. This led me to create Sparking.
